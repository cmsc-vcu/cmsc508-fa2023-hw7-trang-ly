This repository contains my work for Homework 7, in which we create a database using DDL.
<br>
<br>
The database is to represent a company-wide resume capturing the collective skills and certifications of all the people in the company.
<br>
<br>
The following files are contained in the "hw7" folder:

* hw7-ddl.sql - the DDL file that builds the database
* hw7.qmd - the QMD file that contains my source code for Homework 7.
* hw7.html - the HTML file that is rendered by Quarto from hw7.qmd.
